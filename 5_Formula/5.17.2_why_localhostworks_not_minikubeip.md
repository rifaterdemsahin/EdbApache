# 📓 Port Forwarding and Connection Explained

## Problem: ❌ Connection to EDB over Minikube IP Fails
You tried to connect to **EDB (EnterpriseDB)** using the **Minikube IP (192.68.8.1)** after running the following command:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/single-instance-cluster-rw 5432:5432
```

- **Result:** Connection over `192.68.8.1:5432` failed. 😞  
- **Why:** Minikube IP is isolated and not accessible as expected from the host machine.

---

## Solution: ✅ Use `localhost` in Codespaces
Instead of connecting over the Minikube IP, connect to **EDB using `localhost:5432`** in your Codespaces environment where the terminal is running the `kubectl port-forward` command.

- **Command Explanation:**  
  Port forwarding makes the Kubernetes service available **locally on the host machine (`localhost:5432`)**, **not over Minikube's external IP**. 

- **Result:** Connecting to `localhost:5432` works perfectly! 🎉

---

## 🛠 Steps to Connect

1. Run the port-forward command:  
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/single-instance-cluster-rw 5432:5432
   ```

2. Connect to EDB from your host using `localhost:5432`.  
   Example connection string:  
   ```bash
   psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U your_user -d your_database
   ```

3. Verify that the connection works:  
   ```bash
   SELECT 'Connected to EDB 🎉';
   ```

---

### Why This Works:
- **Port-forwarding** exposes the service to the local environment (`localhost`).  
- **Codespaces environment** treats `localhost` as the host, so it can connect directly.
