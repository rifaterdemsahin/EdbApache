It seems like the new pod is still facing an issue with pulling the image, indicated by the `ErrImagePull` status. Here are a few steps to further debug this issue:

1. **Check the pod's events** to get more details about the error:
   ```sh
   kubectl describe pod edb-deployment-578b649bc5-nrc95
   ```

2. **Verify the Docker registry credentials**:
   Ensure that the credentials you used to create the Docker registry secret are correct. You can try logging into the Docker registry manually to verify:
   ```sh
   docker login docker.enterprisedb.com
   ```

3. **Check the image name and tag**:
   Make sure that the image name and tag specified in your deployment configuration are correct and that the image exists in the Docker registry.

4. **Inspect the deployment configuration**:
   Review the deployment YAML file to ensure that the imagePullSecrets field is correctly referencing the secret you created:
   ```yaml
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: edb-container
       image: docker.enterprisedb.com/<your-image>:<your-tag>
     imagePullSecrets:
     - name: edb-registry-secret
   ```

After performing these steps, you should have more information to pinpoint the issue. Let me know what you find, and we can continue troubleshooting from there!
