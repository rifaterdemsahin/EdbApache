EnterpriseDB (EDB) and PostgreSQL have a close relationship, with EDB enhancing PostgreSQL to meet enterprise needs. Here are some key points about their relationship:

1. **Enhancements and Tools**: EDB provides advanced tools and features to PostgreSQL, such as high availability, performance optimization, and security enhancements[1](https://www.w3resource.com/PostgreSQL/snippets/integrating-enterprisedb-with-postgresql.php). This makes PostgreSQL more robust and suitable for enterprise environments.

2. **Oracle Compatibility**: EDB offers compatibility with Oracle databases, simplifying the migration process from Oracle to PostgreSQL[2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/life-beyond-oracle-when-database-relationships-go-wrong). This reduces the need for extensive application rewrites and minimizes disruptions during migration.

3. **Deployment Options**: EDB can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, offering flexibility to organizations based on their infrastructure needs[1](https://www.w3resource.com/PostgreSQL/snippets/integrating-enterprisedb-with-postgresql.php).

4. **High Availability and Replication**: EDB supports clustering and replication, ensuring fault tolerance and high availability for critical applications[1](https://www.w3resource.com/PostgreSQL/snippets/integrating-enterprisedb-with-postgresql.php).

5. **Enterprise-Grade Features**: EDB includes additional features like enhanced encryption, auditing, and advanced monitoring and management tools[1](https://www.w3resource.com/PostgreSQL/snippets/integrating-enterprisedb-with-postgresql.php).

In summary, EDB builds on PostgreSQL's open-source foundation to provide a more powerful, enterprise-ready database solution.
