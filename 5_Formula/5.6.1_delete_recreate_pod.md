It looks like your `edb-deployment` pod is stuck in the `ImagePullBackOff` state, which usually indicates an issue with pulling the Docker image. This could be due to incorrect Docker registry credentials or an issue with the image itself.

To resolve this, you can try the following steps:

1. **Delete the existing pod**:
   ```sh
   kubectl delete pod edb-deployment-578b649bc5-2zpxk
   ```

2. **Recreate the Docker registry secret** to ensure the credentials are correct:
   ```sh
   kubectl delete secret edb-registry-secret
   kubectl create secret docker-registry edb-registry-secret \
     --docker-server=docker.enterprisedb.com \
     --docker-username=<your-username> \
     --docker-password=<your-token> \
     --docker-email=<your-email>
   ```

3. **Restart the deployment** to create a new pod:
   ```sh
   kubectl rollout restart deployment edb-deployment
   ```

After performing these steps, check the status of the pods again:
```sh
kubectl get pods
```

This should help resolve the `ImagePullBackOff` issue. Let me know if you need further assistance!

It seems like the new pod is still facing an issue with pulling the image, indicated by the `ErrImagePull` status. Here are a few steps to further debug this issue:

1. **Check the pod's events** to get more details about the error:
   ```sh
   kubectl describe pod edb-deployment-578b649bc5-nrc95
   ```

2. **Verify the Docker registry credentials**:
   Ensure that the credentials you used to create the Docker registry secret are correct. You can try logging into the Docker registry manually to verify:
   ```sh
   docker login docker.enterprisedb.com
   ```

3. **Check the image name and tag**:
   Make sure that the image name and tag specified in your deployment configuration are correct and that the image exists in the Docker registry.

4. **Inspect the deployment configuration**:
   Review the deployment YAML file to ensure that the imagePullSecrets field is correctly referencing the secret you created:
   ```yaml
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: edb-container
       image: docker.enterprisedb.com/<your-image>:<your-tag>
     imagePullSecrets:
     - name: edb-registry-secret
   ```

After performing these steps, you should have more information to pinpoint the issue. Let me know what you find, and we can continue troubleshooting from there!
