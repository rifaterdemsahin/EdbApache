The image you mentioned, `enterprisedb/edb-as:13`, refers to a Docker image from EnterpriseDB. To determine if it's free for everyone to use, you would need to check the licensing information provided by EnterpriseDB. 

Typically, you can find this information on the Docker Hub page for the image or in the documentation provided by EnterpriseDB. If you have any specific questions about the licensing terms, it's best to refer to the official sources or contact EnterpriseDB directly. 

Is there anything else you'd like to know or need help with?

To use the `enterprisedb/edb-as:13` Docker image, you typically need to sign up for an account with EnterpriseDB and obtain an access token. This is because many EnterpriseDB images are not freely available and require authentication to pull from their repositories[1](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docker-postgresql)[2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/container_images/).

You can find detailed instructions on how to sign up and obtain the necessary token on the EnterpriseDB website or the Docker Hub page for the image. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!

Great! To use your token with Kubernetes, you'll need to create a Kubernetes secret to store your Docker registry credentials. Then, you can reference this secret in your deployment. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create a Docker Registry Secret**:
   Use the following command to create a secret that stores your Docker registry credentials. Replace `<your-username>` and `<your-token>` with your actual EnterpriseDB username and token.

   ```sh
   kubectl create secret docker-registry edb-registry-secret \
     --docker-server=docker.enterprisedb.com \
     --docker-username=<your-username> \
     --docker-password=<your-token> \
     --docker-email=<your-email>
   ```

2. **Update Your Deployment YAML**:
   Modify your deployment YAML to use the created secret. Add the `imagePullSecrets` field under the `spec` section.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: edb-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: edb
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: edb
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: edb
           image: enterprisedb/edb-as:13
           ports:
           - containerPort: 5444
           env:
           - name: POSTGRES_USER
             value: "admin"
           - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
             value: "secretpassword"
           - name: POSTGRES_DB
             value: "demo_db"
           volumeMounts:
           - name: edbdata
             mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
         imagePullSecrets:
         - name: edb-registry-secret
         volumes:
         - name: edbdata
           hostPath:
             path: /path/to/your/edbdata
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: edb-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: edb
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 5444
         targetPort: 5444
     type: NodePort
   ```

This setup ensures that Kubernetes can pull the `enterprisedb/edb-as:13` image from the private registry using your credentials[1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/private_edb_registries/)[2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/private_edb_registries/).
