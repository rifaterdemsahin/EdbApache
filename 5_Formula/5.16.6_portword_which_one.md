Let me explain the different service endpoints available for your PostgreSQL cluster:

# ðŸŽ¯ PostgreSQL Service Types

1. `single-instance-cluster-rw` (Read-Write)
   - Primary endpoint for read AND write operations
   - Use this for general application connections
   - Best for development work

2. `single-instance-cluster-ro` (Read-Only)
   - Read-only endpoint
   - Good for reporting or analytics queries
   - Connects to replicas if available

3. `single-instance-cluster-r` (Replica)
   - Direct connection to replicas
   - Used for specific replica access
   - Similar to 'ro' but more direct

# âœ… Recommendation

For VS Code development, use the read-write endpoint:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/single-instance-cluster-rw 5432:5432
```

This gives you full access to:
- Create tables
- Insert data
- Update records
- Run queries
- Create/modify database objects

The `-rw` endpoint ensures you have full read-write access to your database. Would you like me to help you set up the port forwarding? ðŸ¤”
