To use the `enterprisedb/edb-as:13` Docker image, you typically need to sign up for an account with EnterpriseDB and obtain an access token. This is because many EnterpriseDB images are not freely available and require authentication to pull from their repositories[1](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docker-postgresql)[2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/container_images/).

You can find detailed instructions on how to sign up and obtain the necessary token on the EnterpriseDB website or the Docker Hub page for the image. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
