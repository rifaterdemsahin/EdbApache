It looks like your `edb-deployment` pod is stuck in the `ImagePullBackOff` state, which usually indicates an issue with pulling the Docker image. This could be due to incorrect Docker registry credentials or an issue with the image itself.

To resolve this, you can try the following steps:

1. **Delete the existing pod**:
   ```sh
   kubectl delete pod edb-deployment-578b649bc5-2zpxk
   ```

2. **Recreate the Docker registry secret** to ensure the credentials are correct:
   ```sh
   kubectl delete secret edb-registry-secret
   kubectl create secret docker-registry edb-registry-secret \
     --docker-server=docker.enterprisedb.com \
     --docker-username=<your-username> \
     --docker-password=<your-token> \
     --docker-email=<your-email>
   ```

3. **Restart the deployment** to create a new pod:
   ```sh
   kubectl rollout restart deployment edb-deployment
   ```

After performing these steps, check the status of the pods again:
```sh
kubectl get pods
```

This should help resolve the `ImagePullBackOff` issue. Let me know if you need further assistance!
