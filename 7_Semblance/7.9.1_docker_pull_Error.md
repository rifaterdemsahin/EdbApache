rifaterdemsahin: how to fix it 

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the Docker repository `docker.enterprisedb.com/enterprisedb/edb-as` could not be found. This could be due to a typo in the repository name or the repository not existing.

Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

1. **Verify Repository Name**: Double-check the repository name for any typos. Ensure that the repository exists and is correctly spelled.

2. **Check Repository Access**: Ensure that you have access to the repository. Some repositories may require authentication or specific permissions.

3. **Login to Docker Registry**: If the repository requires authentication, make sure you are logged in to the Docker registry. Use the following command to log in:
    ```sh
    docker login docker.enterprisedb.com
    ```

4. **Consult Documentation**: Refer to the official documentation or contact the repository maintainer to confirm the correct repository name and access requirements.

5. **Alternative Repository**: If the repository does not exist, check if there is an alternative repository or a different tag/version available.

Here is an example of how to pull a Docker image after logging in:

```sh
docker login docker.enterprisedb.com
docker pull docker.enterprisedb.com/enterprisedb/edb-as:13
```

If the repository name is incorrect, you might need to use a different name. For example:

```sh
docker pull docker.enterprisedb.com/enterprisedb/edb-as:latest
```

Make sure to replace `latest` with the correct tag if needed.
