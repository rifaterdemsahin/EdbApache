The error message you're encountering:

```
ERROR: Error opening connection connect ECONNREFUSED 192.168.49.2:5432
```

indicates that the SQLTools extension in your environment is unable to establish a connection to the PostgreSQL service at the IP address `192.168.49.2` on port `5432`. This `ECONNREFUSED` error typically occurs when the connection is actively refused by the target machine, which can happen for several reasons:

1. **PostgreSQL Service Not Running**: The PostgreSQL server might not be running on the specified IP address and port. Ensure that the PostgreSQL service is active and listening on port `5432`.

2. **Firewall or Network Policies**: Network policies or firewall rules within your Minikube environment might be blocking the connection to the PostgreSQL service. Verify that there are no such rules preventing access.

3. **Incorrect IP Address or Port**: The IP address `192.168.49.2` might not be the correct address for your PostgreSQL service. Double-check the service's IP address and port to ensure they are correct.

4. **Service Configuration**: The PostgreSQL service might be configured to accept connections only from certain IP addresses or interfaces. Ensure that it is configured to accept connections from your client.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

- **Verify PostgreSQL Service Status**: Check if the PostgreSQL service is running and listening on the expected IP address and port. You can do this by accessing the Minikube environment and running appropriate commands to check the service status.

- **Check Network Policies and Firewall Rules**: Review the network policies and firewall settings within your Minikube environment to ensure that they allow traffic to the PostgreSQL service on port `5432`.

- **Confirm Service IP and Port**: Ensure that the IP address `192.168.49.2` and port `5432` are correct for your PostgreSQL service. You can obtain the correct IP address by describing the service in Kubernetes:

  ```bash
  kubectl describe service <your-postgresql-service>
 
  kubectl describe service single-instance-cluster-rw 
  ```

  Replace `<your-postgresql-service>` with the name of your PostgreSQL service.

- **Review PostgreSQL Configuration**: Check the PostgreSQL configuration files (such as `pg_hba.conf` and `postgresql.conf`) to ensure that the service is configured to accept connections from your client.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue preventing the SQLTools extension from connecting to your PostgreSQL service in Minikube.

Based on the output of `kubectl describe service single-instance-cluster-rw`, the service `single-instance-cluster-rw` is configured as a `ClusterIP` service with the following details:

- **ClusterIP**: `10.98.153.9`
- **Port**: `5432/TCP`
- **Endpoints**: `10.244.0.5:5432`

A `ClusterIP` service is accessible only within the Kubernetes cluster. To connect to this PostgreSQL service from outside the cluster, you have a couple of options:

1. **Port Forwarding**: You can use `kubectl port-forward` to forward a local port to the service's port, allowing you to connect to the PostgreSQL service from your local machine.

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/single-instance-cluster-rw 5432:5432
   ```

   This command forwards your local port `5432` to the service's port `5432`. After running this command, you can connect to the PostgreSQL service using `localhost:5432`.

2. **Expose the Service Externally**: Modify the service to be of type `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` to expose it outside the cluster. For example, to change the service type to `NodePort`:

   ```bash
   kubectl patch service single-instance-cluster-rw -p '{"spec": {"type": "NodePort"}}'
   ```

   After patching the service, you can retrieve the node port assigned by running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get service single-instance-cluster-rw
   ```

   Look for the `NodePort` value under the `PORT(S)` column. You can then connect to the PostgreSQL service using the node's IP address and the assigned node port.

For more detailed information on exposing services, you can refer to the Kubernetes documentation: citeturn0search2
